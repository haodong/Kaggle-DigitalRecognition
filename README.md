Kaggle-DigitalRecognition
=========================

This is some code I wrote for Kaggle Competetion - [Digit Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/).

Originally code were modified from Andrew Ng's course *Machine Learning*.

New Features:

1.	Customize hidden layer, user could add as many hidden layers as they want.
2.	Sharpen function, which would polarize the pixel value to be either 0 or 255, the default is 194.
3.	Principle component Analysis, so user should change the `K` value in `gg.m` file as their own.
4.	Automatically select lambda.
5.	Run `gg.m` first to gain see general results (both accuracy and F1 measurement).
6.	Then run `gt.m` or not as you wish, which would study the Theta values automatically.
